TASK: Malware Detection & Sandbox Environment Tool
 
 
OVERVIEW:
As part of my Cybersecurity Internship, This tool is designed to detect potential malware on a system,Provide a sandbox environment for safely analyzing malware samples,Monitor malware behavior in a controlled and isolated environment. The primary goal is to allow researchers, students, and cybersecurity enthusiasts to study malicious files without risking their main operating system or network security.

FEATURES:

Malware Detection Engine

Scans files and directories for suspicious patterns or signatures.

Detects potentially malicious executables and scripts.

Sandbox Environment

Runs malware in a secure, isolated virtual environment.

Monitors file system changes, network activity, and process behavior.

Behavior Analysis

Tracks actions performed by the malware.

Logs malicious activities for further investigation.

Kali Linux GUI Integration

User-friendly graphical interface for ease of use.

Built on Kali Linux to leverage built-in cybersecurity tools.

TOOLS USED:

Operating System: Kali Linux

Programming Language: Python 3

GUI Framework: PyQt5 / Tkinter (depending on your implementation)

PyQt5 – GUI

SKILL GAINED:

Malware Analysis – Understanding how malicious files behave and how to detect them.

Sandboxing Techniques – Creating safe, isolated environments for running malware.

Threat Detection – Implementing file scanning, hashing, and pattern matching methods.

Python Programming – Building efficient backend detection logic.

GUI Development – Designing user-friendly interfaces with PyQt5/Tkinter.

Process & File Monitoring – Using tools like psutil to track system changes.

Linux Security Tools – Leveraging Kali Linux's capabilities for security research.

Cybersecurity Best Practices – Following safe and ethical testing protocols.
