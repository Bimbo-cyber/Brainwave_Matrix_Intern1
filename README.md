Task: Malware Detection & Sandbox Environment Tool
 
 
Overview:

This project was developed as part of my Cybersecurity Internship.
The tool is designed to:

Detect potential malware on a system.

Provide a sandbox environment for safely analyzing malware samples.

Monitor malware behavior in a controlled and isolated environment.

The primary goal is to allow researchers, students, and cybersecurity enthusiasts to study malicious files without risking their main operating system or network security.

Features:

Malware Detection Engine

Scans files and directories for suspicious patterns or signatures.

Detects potentially malicious executables and scripts.

Sandbox Environment

Runs malware in a secure, isolated virtual environment.

Monitors file system changes, network activity, and process behavior.

Behavior Analysis

Tracks actions performed by the malware.

Logs malicious activities for further investigation.

Kali Linux GUI Integration

User-friendly graphical interface for ease of use.

Built on Kali Linux to leverage built-in cybersecurity tools.

Technology Stack:

Operating System: Kali Linux

Programming Language: Python 3

GUI Framework: PyQt5 / Tkinter (depending on your implementation)



PyQt5 â€“ GUI

Virtualization/Sandbox Tools: (Optional) VirtualBox, Firejail, or Docker
